            Hi there,

            I can't see an unsubscribe button on your email. Are you aware of the law surrounding direct Marketing and advertising? I've included a link below:

            https://www.gov.uk/marketing-advertising-law/direct-marketing

            I also ask that you manually unsubscribe me from your marketing emails.

            Regards,
            Oli
